# Contributing

Please review the [code of conduct]('CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md') before opening issues
or pull requests.

All pull requests must be accompanied with updated tests before they can be
considered for merging. If you're unsure how to do that, it's ok. Open a pull
request, and we can figure out the tests together!
